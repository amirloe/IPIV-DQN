# IPIV DQN
This repository contains the code I wrote during my thesis work: 

**"Enhancing the Robustness of Deep
Reinforcement Learning Models Using
Prediction Intervals"** 

This thesis was under the supervision of Dr Gilad Katz and Prof Asaf Shabtai.

This repo contains the following directories:

 - `docs` - This folder contains the Thesis work itself and the paper that was written along the thesis.
 - `src` - This folder contains the source code for the thesis work.

The `sbatch_file` is a configuration file for the SLURM scheduler. It is used to run the training code on the BGU cluster.
